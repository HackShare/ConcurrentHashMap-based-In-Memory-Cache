Hashtable-based-In-Memory-Cache
===============================

Intro:

Java Hashtable based In-Memory KeyValue store. 
Cleanup thread periodically cleans up the Hashtable using an index (instance of TreeMap collection which is implemented using Red Black tree algorithm)

API methods:

1. Add (String key, Object value, long TTL) -  
	a. Accepts KeyValue pair along with Time To Live (TTL).

2. Get (String key) - 
	a. Returns an Object associated with this key 
	b. Removes it if expired and throws an exception, "Object expired."
	c. If such a key doesn't exist throws an exception, "Object does not exit/expired."

Iprovements:

1. The frequency of the cleaner needs to be tuned/improved a lot as per the system's needs/capacity
